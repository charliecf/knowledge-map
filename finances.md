## Interchange
Fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions.
Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the "acquiring bank") pays a customer's bank (the "issuing bank"); and for cash transactions the interchange fee is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange.

Card processing fees charged to your card processor (acquiring bank) by the card issuing bank (issuing bank). Raw cost.
