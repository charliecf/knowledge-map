## Interchange
Fee paid between banks for the acceptance of card based transactions.
Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the "acquiring bank") pays a customer's bank (the "issuing bank"); and for cash transactions the interchange fee is paid from the issuer to acquirer, often called reverse interchange.

Card processing fees charged to your card processor (acquiring bank) by the card issuing bank (issuing bank). Raw cost.

Acquiring bank - it goes to merchant and says "hey wouldn't it great to accept these other cards in the network?" Get them to accept VISA. Merchant bank is a member of the VISA network.

Each card type is different.

Qualifications: 
1. type of card that's used.

## Securitization
1. A company with loans or othe income-producing assets - the originator - identifies the assets it wants to remove from its balance sheet and pools them into what is called a reference portfolio.
2. Sells this asset pool to an issuer, such as a SPV, usually by a financiall instituition, specifically to purchase the assets and realize their off-balance-sheet treatment for legal and accounting purposes.

The issuer finances the acquisition of the pooled assets by issuing tradable, interest-bearing securities that are sold to capital market investors.

Securitization represents an alternative and diversified source of finance based on the transfer of credit risk (possibly interest rate and currency risk) from issuers to investors.

- Move assets off balance sheet
- Borrowing against these assets to refinance origination at a fair market rate
- Allows issuer to raise funds to finance the purchase at more cheaply than would be possible on the strength of the originator's balance alone
