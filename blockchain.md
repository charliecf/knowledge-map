Hashing algorithm, many different forms, but always produces the same length

SHA256

* Uniformity
* Non-invertibility (one way)
* Discontinuity (similar inputs will produce different hashes)

**Blockchain** - data structure for storing a carefully ordered sequence of data in a way that makes it very hard to tamper with.

First block - genesis block...
